          <span>Women in Aristophanes: Feminism and Stereotypes in Greek Comedies and Their Reception</span>
          <span>By Ian Chow</span>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <div class = "paragraph">Both Lysistrata and Ecclesiazusae, ancient Greek comedies written by Aristophanes in 411 and 391 BC respectively, depict women in roles of power and leadership. Lysistrata, named after its protagonist, follows the efforts of a group of Greek women from various city-states to end the long-fought Peloponnesian War through a sex strike. Over the course of the play, the women manage to take control of the Acropolis and eventually establish peace between the Athenians and Spartans. Similarly in Ecclesiazusae, translated as The Assemblywomen, women of Athens successfully occupy the Athenian Assembly and issue a series of laws that completely reshape their society. While these two plays feature female figures in power, some may argue that Aristophanes did not intend to support feminist ideas—these seemingly commendatory depictions of women are accompanied by an abundant range of patriarchal Greek stereotypes and implications that women are not capable of governing societies. To many, these portrayals may simply be thought of as a means to ridicule women. The most fundamental aspect of these plays, however, is the fact that Aristophanes is still bringing female leading characters onto the Athenian stage, at times communicating some level of support and empowerment for women, and the resulting receptions of Lysistrata and Ecclesiazusae within antiquity and beyond can be informed by considerations of the nature and influence of Aristophanes’ plays.
</div><div class = "paragraph">Before discussing the texts, it is important to acknowledge the reception, influence, and legacy of Lysistrata after the time period that it was written in. One of the first instances of this reception is the Jacobean comedy The Woman’s Prize, or The Tamer Tamed (1647), by John Fletcher. After marrying a new wife named Maria, Petruchio, the “tamer,” attempts to assert dominance over Maria, but his strategies fail to achieve his goals. Instead, Maria “tames” her husband by thwarting his tactics with her resourcefulness. One of these cases is when she, refusing to consummate her marriage, abstains from sex along with a group of other women, demonstrating the clear influence of Lysistrata. The play seems to have a relatively feminist attitude, especially for one written in the seventeenth century, because in the end Maria is successful in achieving her goal, which was to resolve, or tame, her issues with Petruchio. In addition, another character named Livia, who joins the protest by abstaining from sex, succeeds in avoiding an unwanted arranged marriage and choosing her own husband. Fletcher’s particular use of Lysistrata’s themes of abstinence demonstrates that even during the seventeenth century Aristophanes’ play was being acknowledged for its portrayal of women who take the initiative to make their own choices.
</div><div class = "paragraph">Later uses and portrayals of Lysistrata in film, such as the Western musical comedy The Second Greatest Sex (1955), the Swedish drama The Girls (1968), directed by feminist Mai Zetterling, and the French drama-comedy The Source (2011), continue to make use of the Greek ancient comedy, so as to depict female power, solidarity, and success. While these films and plays can not entirely reflect the overall reception of Lysistrata, let alone the reception of the play during ancient times, the profound range of influence that Lysistrata has shown throughout the centuries cannot be ignored. The play has been repeatedly been set into conversation with contemporary feminist ideas and practices and has generated meaningful ideas in contemporary society. There is a reason why this classical work has been reintroduced so many times, which can only make us wonder whether in antiquity Lysistrata also produced ideas connected to what we now call feminism.
</div><div class = "paragraph">When reading Lysistrata, it is very noticeable that the play portrays women in stereotypical manners, deriving from the ideologies and opinions of patriarchal Greek society. For instance, Lysistrata and Kalonike remark extensively on Lampito’s curvy physique when first meeting her, emphasizing to the audience the body suit that the male actor who plays Lampito is wearing. In doing so, the play ridicules women’s bodies and causes the audience to perceive these characters in an amused and joking manner, even though the goal of the play is no laughing matter—to end the gruesome Peloponnesian War. In addition to accentuating the “women’s” bodies, Lysistrata further amplifies other stereotypes of women, such as obsession over clothing (Kalonike and her saffron dresses), wine, and sex. When Lysistrata proposes that the women go on a sex strike in order to end the war, a majority refuses to accept the plan. Kalonike and Myrrhine even state that they would rather walk on fire than abstain from sex.
</div><div class = "paragraph">However, not all the women are opposed to Lysistrata’s proposal. Lampito understands that their country must acquire peace, and, upon hearing this, Lysistrata calls her “the only woman among them.” In this line, Aristophanes is breaking his use of stereotypes for female characters by praising Lampito, who was previously just a character categorized by her physique. Not only is she being recognized as distinct and assertive among the other women, but she is also being associated with the Athenian ideology of prioritizing public, civic duties over private life.
</div><div class = "paragraph">Although Lysistrata’s statement can be interpreted as ironically claiming that Lysistrata and Lampito are the only women who are most similar to men for their practical thinking, therefore suggesting that they are not accurate representations of Greek women, Aristophanes provides indications that he intends to include these two characters in his portrayal of all women. For example, Lampito expresses a reluctance to no longer have sex, saying, “It is difficult for women to sleep alone without their man” (142-3). She sympathizes with the women’s concerns, which allows the audience to draw similarities between their perception of “radical” and stereotypical women and be able to comprehend the fact that Greek women do not simply conform to patriarchal stereotypes. Additionally, while Lysistrata and Lampito are initially the only women advocating for the abstinence of sex, the rest eventually come to agreement about their sentiments. Despite the fact that the Athenian ideology of public over private life may be thought of as a quality solely possessed by men, which may be exemplified by the application of this concept in Lysistrata as a topic of comedy and absurdity, it is more likely that Aristophanes is suggesting that this ideology should not only be applied to men, but also to women. Ultimately, the women intend to put a stop to the war—a goal that is easy to sympathize with, regardless of gender. Aristophanes’ stereotypical portrayal of women in various scenes has its harmful effects, but simultaneously he is no longer representing women as simple-minded individuals as many other Greek plays do, but rather as capable, leading characters in Lysistrata.
</div><div class = "paragraph">In another scene in Lysistrata, Myrrhine, a woman who has joined the cause of ending the war, is confronted by her husband Kinesias and their baby. Using their baby as an incentive to come down from the walls of the Acropolis, Kinesias is desperate to be reunited with his wife, but Myrrhine refuses to comply with his requests. He attempts to make her feel guilty, saying, “Do you not have pity on your child who has been unwashed and unnursed for six days?” (880-1). In the following line, Myrrhine answers, “I do have pity, but his father is careless.” Kinesias then continues to complain about his misery and the state of their home. This scene could be interpreted as a criticism of the women in Lysistrata for abandoning their families and domestic responsibilities, but the reversal of gender roles is too prominent to be ignored. Kinesias has been left at home to care for their baby, while Myrrhine, away from the home, has been carrying out a plan to stop the war. Moreover, Kinesias fails to manage their home simply due to his wife’s absence, whereas Myrrhine and her comrades have been nothing but successful in their plans. That is, Kinesias fails to take on a “woman’s” role, while Myrrhine succeeds in taking on a “man’s” role.
</div><div class = "paragraph">Aside from the criticism of Kinesias, the scene seems also to comment on the position of women in their society in two ways. Firstly, it suggests that married women do not receive the recognition they deserve for their domestic responsibilities. While Greek society does notice the importance of women’s work in the home—otherwise a whole gender of the human population would not be subjected to such tasks for the whole duration of adulthood—it does not praise female roles in society, as it does male roles. The disastrous state of the home immediately following Myrrhine’s departure is an attempt to bring recognition to the significance of Myrrhine’s, and more broadly women’s, domestic work. Secondly, the scene indicates that women are more capable than what their society believes to be the case, as shown by Myrrhine’s success in taking on an active, assertive role in changing the course of the Peloponnesian War. Once again, Lysistrata is presenting feminist views. Whether completely intentional or not, one can imagine the sting of guilt felt in the stomachs of male audience members as they laid eyes on this scene.
</div><div class = "paragraph">Some may argue that simply the presence of female stereotypes throughout Lysistrata eliminates any possibility that Aristophanes intended to empower women, and this claim is not unfounded. When Athenian and Spartan delegates meet with Lysistrata to negotiate a peace treaty and end the Peloponnesian War, the delegates are presented with a beautiful, naked woman named Reconciliation, and they use her body, on which is painted the map of Greece, as a means of negotiating the distribution of Greek territories. This scene has gone beyond depicting simple stereotypes—it goes to the extent of completely objectifying Reconciliation by portraying her as a dehumanized individual whose sole purpose is to benefit the lives and societies of men. However, the simultaneous presence of Lysistrata may possibly affect our understanding of the scene. While Reconciliation is a passive character whose name is simply a noun, suggesting that she may be a deity or a representation of one, Lysistrata, clearly a mortal, takes on an active role in negotiating peace between the two sides. When comparing these two characters, Lysistrata is the more suitable representation of Greek women. Reconciliation, on the other hand, can be perceived as the physical manifestation of an idea—abstract concepts are often portrayed as corporeal beings in Greek mythology. This interpretation of the scene does not excuse Aristophanes for what he has written, nor would it urge audiences to refrain from indulging in the portrayal of Reconciliation, but when considering the play as a whole, the representation, leadership, and success of Lysistrata and her comrades is relatively progressive in the context of classical literature.
</div><div class = "paragraph">The other play by Aristophanes depicting women in power, Ecclesiazusae, follows the story of a group of women, led by a woman named Praxagora, who propose a series of new laws that may be questionable and contentious, which risks causing male viewers to believe that women are unable to govern a functional society. Although some of the laws, including the establishment of a common fund and the provision of basic necessities, could possibly be beneficial to the people of Athens, others seem rather ridiculous. The most striking of such laws allows an individual to have the right to sex, as long as they first have sex with the ugliest member of society. The absurdity of these laws is shown in the following scene, in which a young man named Epigenes desires to sleep with his girlfriend, but he is confronted by three old women. Each claims that she is uglier than the rest so that she may sleep with Epigenes. Since their requests for the right to sex are legally binding, this particular society supports and respects the three old women and does not show sympathy toward Epigenes; rather, he is considered as an offender of the law. Nevertheless, the audience lives in a completely different society, as do we in the present time, so we view Epigenes as a victim of unjust laws. While he is not praised as a model citizen, our perception of the old women is besmirched by their descriptions, which constantly inform us about their old age and decrepitude: “moldy old hag,” “apparition of damnation,” “a monkey plastered with makeup,” and “a crone arisen from the underworld.” We are meant to sympathize with Epigenes and disapprove of this “right to sex” law, and it seems as if Aristophanes has written this play in order to mock Praxagora’s efforts to establish fair legislation.
</div><div class = "paragraph">However, the intentions behind these laws are not as unfounded as the laws themselves are. Amia Srinivasan’s essay, “Does anyone have the right to sex?”, takes into consideration the consequences of the two possibilities for the right to sex—either acknowledge it, and the complications are endless and extremely harmful, or don’t acknowledge it, and older women like those shown in the scene with Epigenes would have less access to sex. While we are not particularly concerned for the three old women, the overall result is that certain preferences for skin color, height, weight, age, etc. would be perpetuated by societal ideals that influence our minds, even unconsciously. The former possibility for the right of sex, acknowledging it, is far worse than the latter, but that is not to say that the exclusion of certain traits as a result of “personal preferences” is justifiable. In passing this law, Praxagora intends to confront Athenian standards of beauty. Although this particular method of “fixing” Greek society is extremely authoritarian, and several issues would arise from giving an individual the right to sex after complying with the law’s requirements, the intention of Praxagora to address prejudices is defensible. 
</div><div class = "paragraph">The question still remains of whether Aristophanes truly intended to empower women in Ecclesiazusae, or whether he was criticizing the current state of the Athenian Assembly. According to Classicist Erich Segal, Aristophanes believed that the Athenian Assembly was an unsatisfactory form of government, and that the ability of women in Ecclesiazusae to secretly pass as men in the Assembly attested to the fact that the assemblymen were inadequate leaders and indistinguishable from women, implying deep condescension for women and feminine men. However, why would have Aristophanes used women to depict the incompetence of Athenian leaders when the representation of women in leading roles was extremely rare? It is crucial to consider the context of the play—a patriarchal society that is not very receptive to female representation, let alone female characters who take on leadership positions. Additionally, Praxagora has shown to be successful in her endeavors and an advocate against prejudice, which seemingly serves the purpose of endorsing women, rather than denouncing the Assembly. While it is easy to be dismissive towards Ecclesiazusae, a play incorporating elements of female empowerment was unprecedented in Greek society, and the sheer inclusion of powerful, female characters on Athenian stages would have been astonishing to a male audience.
</div><div class = "paragraph">Some may be led to question whether there is even a need to debate upon the nature of these plays’ receptions, when both Lysistrata and Ecclesiazusae are far from ideal in terms of the representation of women—from the uses of common stereotypes to the objectification of Reconciliation to the demeaning depictions of Praxagora’s laws. Did all audience members use the stories of Aristophanes to simply ridicule women? The strict aspect of Greek patriarchal ideologies and societies seemingly eliminates any possibility that progressive ideas of feminism would have be able to develop. Be this as it may, the fact that their society is patriarchal—that they are rarely exposed to the representation of women—completely alters the way in which we should examine this example of classical reception within antiquity. The leadership of Lysistrata and Praxagora, the empowerment of women across all of Greece, and the demonstrated success of these characters (even if the success of Praxagora did not result in an ideal outcome) indicate that the hints of “feminism” behind Aristophanes’ works must have had some level of influence on the minds of viewers. Moreover, the legacy of Lysistrata in later works demonstrates that the ancient Greek play has been generative for feminist ideas and that Aristophanes has had a lasting influence on representations, philosophies, and societies from antiquity to the present.

          <span>The Representation of Women in Aristophanes’ Lysistrata</span>
          <span>By Sarah Whitney</span>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <div class = "paragraph">Aristophanes, even as he creates an absurdly comical scenario for the entertainment of his male audience, details an image of female empowerment centered upon what Ancient Greek women are able to control societally. Through his play Lysistrata, a comedy about women using the power of abstinence to manipulate their husbands into ending the Peloponnesian War, he seemingly writes about his female characters, like Lysistrata, in ways so preposterous to Athenian standards that they actually tip the scale into becoming more like present-day women, though it is unclear whether Aristophanes is aware of his affect and is commenting on the gender roles of his time, or if he is simply writing to get a good laugh out of ridiculous caricatures. The “modern woman” and other “contemporary” ideas come from the dramatized exertion of power and female unity that are frequent throughout the entire play but also present themselves in more subtle ways.
</div><div class = "paragraph">There are several things that Aristophanes blows out of proportion throughout Lysistrata, for example, the hypersexual nature of all of the characters, both in the sense of the characters’ need for sex and the obvious sexual puns at every corner. This overt sexuality plays into the more “ancient” idea of women, with a similar effect as the exaggerated costuming: the reduction of women into sexual objects. There are also parts of the dialogue where characters explicitly confine women to their “traditional” roles: child-rearing, cooking, cleaning, etc. However, the fact that the women are played by men adds another layer to Aristophanes’ choices. His particular image of men extravagantly dressed as women moves away from the subjugation and objectification of women and into a more meta-representation of the female role. The artificiality is the point. Aristophanes, intentionally or unintentionally, brings notice to masculine expectations for female behavior and sexuality and comments on the way women are treated in life—that is, they are treated as elaborately costumed and masked fantasies or stereotypes. Even the sexual openness of the women in Lysistrata, their willingness to talk openly of their desires, is another aspect of the play that is so unbelievable and hilarious in a traditional sense that it loops back to the opposite end of the spectrum (ranging from prudishly traditional to open and modern), which is present-day thought.
</div><div class = "paragraph">The insertion and spotlighting of radical figures, such as the Old Women and Lysistrata herself, play most directly into the “modern” aspects of Lysistrata. Banding together and giving civic life to Lysistrata’s legislation, the Old Women clearly represent the kind of female role in society that is sought after in modern contexts. Lysistrata is a leader of a united movement of women, including even the women of the opposing side of the war. She recognizes  the sexual power that women wield inside of the home and implements it in a widespread, unified way for the benefit of all of Athens. Aristophanes’ female characters are more than competent, as they manage to change the course of the political atmosphere and finally accomplish more than the men at war. In this way, they are contemporary. Lysistrata and her comrades take on the traditionally masculine societal roles, which at the same time leaves the men in the feminine roles, reducing them to bumbling inept objects with exaggerated sex organs, bearing similarities to the “traditional” woman.
</div><div class = "paragraph">Through the comical overdone women of Lysistrata, Aristophanes not only manages to create contemporary images of empowered women leading society, but also provides commentary on the gender roles and societal boundaries of Ancient Greece.</p>

          <span>Translation and Analysis of Iliad 22 [496-514]</span>
          <span>By Alexis Bienstock</span>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>But a boy whose parents are living drives him out of the banquet,<br>
hitting him with his fists and attacking him with his words:<br>
"Leave! Your father is not dining with us."<br>
And the tearful boy goes away to his widowed mother,<br>
Astyanax, who in prior days, on the knees of his father,<br>
would eat only the marrow and the rich fat of sheep.<br>
Yet when sleep would take him and he was done with his child’s play,<br>
he would go to sleep in a bed, in the arms of his nurse, in a soft<br>
bed, with his heart filled with happy thoughts.<br>
Now, with his dear father gone, he has much to suffer:<br>
he, whom the Trojans have called Astyanax, lord of the city,<br>
since it was you alone who defended the gates and the long walls.<br>
But now, beside the curving ships, far away from your parents,<br>
the writhing worms will feed, when the dogs are satiated,<br>
on your naked body, though in your house there is clothing laid up<br>
that is fine-textured and pleasant, made by the hands of women.<br>
But truly all of these I will burn up in the burning fire,<br>
no use to you, since you will never be laid in them;<br>
but in your kleos, from the Trojan men and the Trojan women.’<br></p>
<hr>
<div class = "paragraph">
At the end of Iliad 22, Andromache addresses her widowship and Hector’s death by centering her narration around the experience—anticipated in imagination—of their son,Astyanax. She begins on line 296 by describing a potential instance of Astyanax enduring exclusion in detail. Andromache does not address Hector by name in this section, and does not directly criticize him. Rather, Andromache’s lamentation is especially powerful for its more oblique evocation of the aftermath of Hector’s decisions and actions. She can implicitly blame Hector for leaving their son to face humiliation and social isolation, while simultaneously distancing herself from responsibility for Astyanax’s suffering.
</div><div class = "paragraph">Instead of saying that she fears Astyanax will face humiliation, Andromache tells a tale of Astyanax actually receiving this humiliation. This latter method then becomes so much more powerful than the former, as the reader can hear Andromache’s criticism of Hector through the criticism of his peer, as well as see firsthand the disgrace that Astyanax will suffer. The reader knows that Astyanax’s exclusion will not be limited to this imagined instant, but will be repeated throughout his life. Andromache further dramatizes this shift in status through a detailed remembrance of how good Astyanax’s life was like prior to Hektor’s death.
</div><div class = "paragraph">This lamentation is also especially wrenching and unique in that Andromache never says Hektor’s name. He is described as πατρὸς “father” (22.500) in Andromache’s beginning narration, and from there, Hektor is directly addressed as “you” in the relative clause οἶος γάρ σφιν ἔρυσο πύλας καὶ τείχεα μακρά, “since it was you alone who defended the gates and the long walls.” This relative clause blurs the separation of thought between the life that Astyanax will face and the death that awaits Hektor. Andromache ties the death of Hector more explicitly to her story about Astyanax’s social humiliation, while displaying the relationship between father and son.
</div><div class = "paragraph">Andromache evokes the relationship between Hektor and Astyanax not only through the relative clause, but also, though less favorably, through the phrase νόσφι τοκήων “far away from your parents.” While Astyanax is missing his father in childhood, Hektor’s parents are still alive at the time of his death. A son without a father, parents without a son: by focussing upon these consequences, Andromache criticizes Hektor for his untimely death.</p>

          <span>Translation and Analysis of Shield of Achilles [Iliad]</span>
          <span>By Dimitri Zhao</span>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <div class = "paragraph">On the shield Hephaestus created two beautiful cities of mortal men. And in one, there were marriages and banquets. The townspeople were leading the bride from their rooms through the city under the light of torches, and a loud birdsong had broken out. Young men followed the circles of the dance, and amongst them the flutes and lyres kept up their music while the women standing at the door of the courthouse admired them. But the people were crowding in the marketplace, where a quarrel had broken out, and two men were fighting over the blood-price of a man who had been murdered. One man promised full payment in a public restitution, but the other refused and would accept nothing. Both rushed for a judge, so as to have a verdict; and people were shouting on either side to support both men. But the guards kept the people in control, as meanwhile the elders stood on benches of polished stone in the sacred circle and held in their hands the speaking-staffs of those who lift their voices. The two men rushed before them, and took turns speaking their case. Between them two talents of gold lay on the ground, to be given to the judge who spoke the most just opinion in this case.
</div><hr>
	<div class = "paragraph">This passage describes one of the cities depicted on Achilles’ shield. This city is happy, with marriages and dancing, but there are still problems, as a dispute has arisen between two men about a blood-price in a case of murder, and they rush into a court to resolve it. This passage is the earliest depiction in western literature of the ancient Greek judicial system at work, but there is also a deeper meaning.
</div><div class = "paragraph">In a passage that soon follows [insert line numbers], a second city is described. It is a reverse mirror of the first city, war ravaged and besieged, but the citizens hold out, and the word choice seems to imply that this is a good-within-the-bad situation. In the original town, however, the poet describes a quarrel between two men despite the town being otherwise happy. Since the two situations are mirrors, the quarrel should be shown to be a bad thing contrasting starkly with its surroundings, making the shield a sort of yin-yang symbol.
</div><div class = "paragraph">Moreover, this interpretation has a larger meaning within the Iliad more generally. The entire shield seems to be a euphemism for Achilles’ two possible paths through life: the hero who dies young, or the ordinary man who leads a long life. The shield shows discord in the perceived peaceful life, and honor and hope in the life of war. This represents both Achilles’ choice and the way that ancient Greeks viewed war.

          <span>Narcissus: A Short Story</span>
          <span>By Emily Lo</span>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <div class = "paragraph">Narcissus has always been a beautiful young boy. From an early age, it was impossible for others not  to love him. On the first day of kindergarten, Narcissus was immediately surrounded by a large group of both girls and boys when he entered the classroom. Even the teacher paid special attention to Narcissus. Soon, Narcissus himself was never seen carrying his own backpack or lunchbox in the hallways. Instead, the ever-present entourage of Narcissus’ followers did everything for him. However, Narcissus never particularly cared for his followers. At least he never showed it. There was such intense pride in his delicate form.
	</div><div class = "paragraph">In middle school, a fanclub for Narcissus was created. Almost everyone in the entire school were members of this club because everyone adored him. Boys, girls, and teachers all had a strange mutual desire for Narcissus. The girls as well as some boys pursued him and wanted to date him. Again, just as in elementary school, Narcissus was not affected by all this attention from others. Although he was loved by all, he had not yet discovered whom he himself loved.
	</div><div class = "paragraph">One day, Narcissus was accidentally separated from his followers in a park, which had never happened before. He tried to text his lead follower, but mistyped one number and instead reacheded Echo. Echo was already an admirer of Narcissus because she had seen him walking with his followers a few days prior and had been instantly inflamed with a desire for him. She happened to be again in the same park as Narcissus. Although she had noticed him, he did not see her, or even know who she was. Narcissus’ text, which was supposed to go to the lead follower, was Did you guys leave here? Since Echo had dropped her phone the previous day and was now able to text only the last of what had been prior texted, Echo replied here.As soon as he saw the reply, Narcissus began looking all around, trying to spot his followers, but he could not find them. When Echo, however, saw him looking around, she realized that she was texting Narcissus. Narcissus then texts Come here! And Echo with her broken phone replies come here. Narcissus became obviously distressed. Echo could see that he was upset, but she restrained herself from approaching him. Narcissus texts We must stick together and Echo responds together. She was no longer able to restrain herself. Echo rushes to Narcissus and hugs him from the back because she could not stand seeing Narcissus so frustrated and confused. Narcissus quickly freed himself from Echo and sprinted away from her. It was rumored that the sadness of rejection caused Echo to never leave her room. No one has seen her since.
	</div><div class = "paragraph">Narcissus created an Instagram account when he was sixteen, primarily to please the innumerable daily requests he received. His account quickly gained thousands of followers, even though he never posted any pictures. He was not interested in his rapid rise in followers, or at least he did not appear to care.
</div><div class = "paragraph">Narcissus had a large following of people around him at all times ever since he
could remember, but eventually it became boring for him. As he was looking through his phone, Narcissus spotted a feature on Instagram that he had never used before: posting pictures. He took a quick selfie of himself and posted it. Within a minute, his picture had gotten hundreds of likes. Narcissus, however, did not notice the ever-increasing likes, but was instead  stunned by the beauty that appeared on his phone screen. Surely he had seen pictures of himself before, but it was only at a glance. Never had he truly realized why so many people had fallen in love with him. Now he too desired the one on the phone screen. Narcissus could not resist the beautiful figure that is himself! He was seized by the image of his own beauty on his screen. Narcissus now admired everything that he himself was admired for. He desired the one on the screen. How often he kissed the phone screen in vain!
</div><div class = "paragraph">Soon, Narcissus was unable to do anything but stare at the image of
himself that stared back at him on his phone. He kept on taking pictures of himself and posting them on his Instagram account because that was the only way to bring his love back to him. Mirrors were not enough, nor were pictures of himself not found on his screen. The only way Narcissus could find the one he truly desired was to post pictures on Instagram. It was impossible to see Narcissus without his phone in hand. At first, his followers were very excited that Narcissus had started to post pictures of himself. However, they also began to see Narcissus less and less in real life. Even if they did see him, he was only looking at his phone—and he was often seen shouting, “I love you, marvelous boy!” or some other declaration of love. His followers did not know what had happened, but they knew he was no longer the same Narcissus and slowly began to lose interest in him. Even though he was still beautiful, he began wasting away more and more every day, as he gave up all proper care for his body. He was only concerned with the love that appeared to him on his phone. Narcissus knew that he would never be able to truly have his one desire: himself. Death would have been easier to bear than this intense heartache. Narcissus knew what he had to do to soothe his pain: he beat his chest with his own fists. A crimson weal formed on his naked torso. Narcissus had relieved his pain, but his image remained on his Instagram account. Others followed in his footsteps.

1 Oh, you unthinking Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your own eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. 2 I want to learn just one thing from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law or by hearing with faith? 3 Are you so unthinking? After beginning with the Spirit, would you now be completed by the flesh? 4 Have you suffered so many things in vain—if indeed it was in vain? 5 So again, I ask: Does God give you the Spirit and make miracles amongst you by the works of the law or by hearing with belief? 6 So also Abraham “believed in God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.” 7 Understand, then, that those of faith are the sons of Abraham. 8 Scripture foresaw that God would set right the Gentiles through faith, preaching the Gospel beforehand to Abraham:  “All nations will be blessed through you.” 9 So that those of faith are blessed along with faithful Abraham. 10 For all who rely on the works of the law are beneath a curse, as it was written “cursed are all who don’t continue to do everything written in the Scroll of the Law. 11 It is clear that no one is more right before God, because “the righteous will live by faith.” 12 The law is not of faith, but rather says “the one who does these things will live by them.” 13 Christ rescued us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.” 14 He rescued us so that the Blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that we should receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
</div><div class = "paragraph">15 Brothers and sisters, this is an example from human life: Just as no one can annul or add to a humanly ratified covenant, so too in this case. 16 The promises were told to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” but “to your seed”—meaning One, who is Christ. 17 I mean this: the law that came four hundred and thirty years later does not void the covenant ratified by God and so nullify the promise. 18 For, if the inheritance is from the law, it is no longer of the promise. But, God gave it to Abraham through the promise. 19 Why then is there the law? It is added because of transgressions, until the arrival of the Seedto whom the promise referred. The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator. 20 A “mediator,” however, is not of one, but God is one. 21 Does the law, then, go against the promises of God? Let it not be! For, if the law had been given that could restore life, then righteousness would be from the law. 22 But the Scripture imprisoned everything in sin so that the promise of faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
</div><div class = "paragraph">23 Before the faith came, we were kept under watch by the law, confined until the faith-to-come would be uncovered. 24 So that the law has been our guardian until Christ came so that we might be justified through faith. 25 Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. 26 For you are all sons of God through faith in Jesus Christ. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ, you have clothed yourselves in Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor man, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 If you are of Christ, you are the seed of Abraham and heirs according to the promise.
